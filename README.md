##### Intersective adjectives

Intersective adjectives are the most restricted ones.
The adjective "angry" in the sentence "That man is angry" 
is an example of an intersective adjective. The meaning 
of angry man then can be computed as the intersection 
of angry things and men.

Typical Properties can often be expressed or specified by their
type and "intersective adjectives".

What is the Jane's "address"? vs What is Jane's "home address"?
Similarly, the "home" adjective could also be applied to her "phone number".
